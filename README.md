## JWT Authentication with Spring Boot

This repository provides a simple implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication with Spring Boot. JWT is a widely used standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications.

### Features

- User registration: Allows users to register and create an account.
- User login: Handles user authentication by generating a JWT upon successful login.
- Secured endpoints: Protects certain endpoints that require authentication with JWT.
- Token validation: Verifies the authenticity and validity of incoming JWT tokens.

### Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd jwt-spring-boot`
3. Configure the application.properties file with your database credentials and JWT secret key.
4. Build and run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`
5. Access the application at: `http://localhost:8080`

### Usage
